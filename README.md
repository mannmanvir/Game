# CSC-130-Final-Project---Game

This is a semester long Java-based game in which we were provided a custom game engine to work with. The objective I chose for this game was to create an animated, responsive stick figure that can traverse across the game environment and interact with various objects present in the world. Features present in this game include an information button which gives the user a sense of direction, bounding boxes that block off parts of the game world as needed, and objects the user can examine which prints dialog lines to the screen. All of these featues work in conjunction with user keypresses to create a more seamless experience. 

To play, simply press on the green "Code" button that is present on this repositories home page, and download the ZIP file. Once downloaded, extract the files and load up Eclipse (or any chosen IDE). Import the project and make sure to select the 'CSC_130_Final' folder. The code can be ran from "main.java" which should load the game environemnt in a new full screen window.
